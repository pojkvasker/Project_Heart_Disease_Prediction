# Project_Heart_Disease_Prediction
 15 credit project course in embedded systems
 
 Goal: An app that predicts whether or not you are in the risk zone of having a heart disease based on Bluetooth sensors using a trained classifier. ECG, cholesterol and blood pressure will be the Bluetooth Low Energy sensors used. Previous work have been done in classifying arrythmia based on ECG data. The classifier of choice will be trained on the heart disease dataset from the UCI machine learning repository.
